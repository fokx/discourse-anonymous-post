## Current functionality and plan
* currently only support reply, plan to support 'create new topic anonymously'
* currently all users share **one** anonymous account, plan to support 'different identity for each user'
* plan: rate limit (by IP / user)
* plan: add configuration to limit anonymous posting to certain categories
